Re-Create An Etsy Page - https://www.etsy.com/search?q=whiskey

1. Utilize the data for whatever search term you use - [DATA HERE](https://api.etsy.com/v2/listings/active?api_key=h9oq2yf3twf4ziejn10b717i&keywords=whiskey&includes=Images,Shop). Be sure to use XHR to grab the data. You will need to have the CORS extension turned on in your browser.
2. You are free to change the search term to whatever you'd like.
3. Everything should be styled as closely as possible, including the Header/Sidebar/Links/Search (you can ignore the footer)
4. You should implement hover events and link the items to their proper Etsy product pages (items only, other links can be just linked to `#`)
5. No need to make any of the form elements work, just style them properly
6. You can ignore the "Top categories for ..." section as that is not in the data. You can also ignore the "Ad" icon.

> Pro Tip, worry about the structure first, the JS second and the fine details of the design last

> Note: The assets (heart, cart and hamburger icons) are in an assets folder for you.
